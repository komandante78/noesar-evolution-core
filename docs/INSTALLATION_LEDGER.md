## Phase 0 — Bootstrap, governance, persistent state and private Git repository

**UTC:** 2026-07-25T01:13:11Z
**Result:** see `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`

### Environment observed

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | Unraid, Linux 6.18.38 |
| `PROJECT_ROOT` | `/mnt/cachec/NOESAR_EVOLUTION` (did not exist; created) |
| Free space on `/mnt/cachec` | 325 GB available of 466 GB |
| `git` | 2.55.0 — available |
| `gh` (GitHub CLI) | **not installed** (`command not found`) |
| `gitleaks` | **not installed** |
| `trufflehog` | **not installed** |
| `node` / `npm` | available (`/usr/local/bin`) |

### Source archive verification (no extraction performed)

Location: `/mnt/user/downloads/NOESAR_EVOLUTION_FINAL`
Method: `sha256sum` over each `.zip`, compared to the expected values supplied with
the phase specification and to the vendor manifest `SHA256SUMS(2).txt`.

| # | Archive | SHA-256 | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `NOESAR_EVOLUTION_01_COMPLETE_PRODUCT_SOURCE_V4_FINAL(2).zip` | `0b128b16…8b8a033c` | OK |
| 02 | `NOESAR_EVOLUTION_02_RUNTIME_AND_DEPLOYMENT_V4_FINAL(2).zip` | `c15193ee…6e5d5ffb` | OK |
| 03 | `NOESAR_EVOLUTION_03_CAPABILITIES_AND_SDK_V4_FINAL(2).zip` | `e6a68bf1…1724f2de76` | OK |
| 04 | `NOESAR_EVOLUTION_04_SECURITY_AND_ACCEPTANCE_V4_FINAL(2).zip` | `4ffb0d4f…5ff4a1ed72` | OK |
| 05 | `NOESAR_EVOLUTION_05_FINAL_RELEASE_AND_OPERATIONS_V4_FINAL(2).zip` | `7a58bdda…ad01424c5` | OK |

**5 of 5 checksums match exactly.** Archive count is exactly 5, as required.

**Deviation recorded (content-neutral):** all five files on disk carry a ` (2)`
suffix before the extension — a browser duplicate-download artifact. The names in
the phase specification and in the vendor manifest have no suffix. Content is
byte-identical to the manifest, so the deviation is naming only. The files were
**not** renamed: renaming source archives is a mutation outside the Phase 0 scope
and outside `PROJECT_ROOT`. Phase 1 must resolve the names by glob or by an explicit
rename instruction from the owner.

Two non-archive files also present and left untouched: `FINAL_PACKAGE_INDEX(2).md`,
`FINAL_PACKAGING_REPORT(2).txt`.

### Workspace created

```text
/mnt/cachec/NOESAR_EVOLUTION/

```

No pre-existing directory was found at `PROJECT_ROOT`, so no inventory or ownership
verification of prior content was required.

### Prohibitions honoured in this phase

| Prohibition | Observed |
|---|---|
| `PRODUCT_EXTRACTION` | false — no archive opened |
| `DOCKER_BUILD` | false |
| `CONTAINER_START` | false |
| `DATABASE_MUTATION` | false |
| `INSTALLATION` | false |
| `PRODUCTION_TOUCHED` | false — no existing container, service, or dataset read or written |
| `ZIP_REPACKAGING` | false |

### Git — local repository

`git init -b main` inside `PROJECT_ROOT`. 12 files staged and committed; the five
archives are excluded by `.gitignore` and were never staged.

Staged-set audit before commit:

- `git ls-files` → 12 files.
- `file(1)` on each → all plain UTF-8 text or JSON. **No binary of any kind.**
- Pattern check for `.zip|.tar|.gz|.7z|.exe|.dll|.so|.dylib|.sqlite|.db|.pem|.key|.env`,
  `secrets/`, `credentials/`, `BACKUPS/` in the staged set → **no match**.
- Absolute paths published: only `/mnt/cachec/NOESAR_EVOLUTION` (the project root)
  and `/mnt/user/downloads/NOESAR_EVOLUTION_FINAL` (the archive location). Both are
  technically necessary for the state/handoff mechanism to resume across sessions,
  per rule 29. No third-party infrastructure, hostname, or credential path exposed.
- `git diff --cached --stat` → 12 files, 976 insertions, 0 deletions.

**Commit 1:** `c3ad683e977c44e421a9141a3c7640720c48f84d`
`chore(phase-0): bootstrap NOESAR Evolution governance and resumable workflow`

**Commit 2:** state and handoff (this update), committed separately as an atomic
follow-up because the state file must record the SHA of commit 1.

### Secret scan — heuristic, declared

`gitleaks` and `trufflehog` are both absent from this host, and rule 45 forbids
installing new tooling to satisfy the scan. A **heuristic scan** was run instead.

Five patterns over the staged set, all returning **zero matches**:

| # | Pattern | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | credential keyword (`api_key`/`secret`/`token`/`password`/`cookie`/`bearer`/…) followed by an assignment to a quoted value ≥6 chars | no match |
| 2 | `BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY` / `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` blocks | no match |
| 3 | known provider token shapes (`ghp_`/`gho_`/`sk-`/`xox*-`/`AKIA…`/`AIza…`) | no match |
| 4 | credential-bearing connection strings (`scheme://user:pass@host`) | no match |
| 5 | contiguous hex runs ≥40 chars (possible key material) | no match |

**Detector self-test:** the patterns were run against a synthetic canary file written
outside the repository containing an api-key assignment, a `ghp_` token, a
credential-bearing URL, and a private-key header. **All four were flagged**, then the
canary was removed. The zero-match result on the staged set is therefore meaningful
rather than a silently broken check.

An initial scan attempt placed `--cached` after the pattern, which git interpreted as
a revision; it errored and produced misleading "no match" output. This was caught and
the scan was re-run with correct argument order. The results above are from the
corrected run.

### GitHub — blocked

`gh` is **not installed** on this host. Verified by `command -v gh`, by checking
`/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/opt/gh/bin`, `/root/.local/bin`, `/mnt/user/appdata/gh`,
and by a bounded `find` over `/usr/local`, `/usr/bin`, `/opt` — absent everywhere.
No `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` is set in the environment
(checked by variable name only; no value was printed).

Consequently `gh repo create NOESAR-EVOLUTION --private --source . --remote origin --push`
could not be executed. Recorded as `GITHUB_STATUS=BLOCKED_AUTHENTICATION` (blocker
B-001). **No token was written to any file** and no remote was configured
(`git remote -v` → empty). The local repository was completed regardless, as the
phase specification requires.

### Phase 0 outcome

`COMPLETE_WITH_BLOCKER` — all local objectives met; the GitHub remote (B-001) and
real secret scanning (B-002) remain open. Neither blocks Phase 1.
`NEXT_PHASE=1`. Phase 1 was **not** started.
